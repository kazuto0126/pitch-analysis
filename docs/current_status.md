# Current status — Phase 1 accepted; Phase 2 reliability baseline

Updated: 2026-09-25

**Phase 1 = PASSED**

The five formal Yoshinobu Yamamoto single-pitch inputs passed the existing
Phase 1 clip-level acceptance checks. Phase 2 now evaluates tracking and
per-joint pose reliability on those same five clips. No Phase 1 threshold,
PitcherSelector rule, pose algorithm, interpolation, or smoothing policy was
changed.

**Phase 2 = IN PROGRESS — human ground truth pending.** The baseline runner,
reports, and annotation workflow are available; program execution is not a
Phase 2 acceptance result.

## Phase 2 baseline

Latest output: `analysis_results/phase2_yamamoto_20260925_01/`. It contains
fresh five-pitch predictions and overlays, per-pitch `pose_reliability.json`
and `tracking_reliability.json`, separate blank `ground_truth.json` templates,
and `evaluation_summary.json`. Fresh raw pose CSV and overlay MP4 hashes match
the Phase 1 final run for all five clips after introducing the `PoseEstimator`
interface. MediaPipe remains the backend.

| Pitch | Tracking reliability | Track break | Pose signal reliability | Throwing elbow joint raw | Throwing elbow angle raw | Throwing wrist raw / longest missing |
|---|---|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `pitch_001` | reliable | 0 | unreliable | 66.7% | 51.72% | 51.7% / 32 frames |
| `pitch_002` | reliable | 0 | unreliable | 88.6% | 65.14% | 65.1% / 31 frames |
| `pitch_003` | reliable | 0 | unreliable | 84.3% | 53.04% | 53.9% / 18 frames |
| `pitch_004` | partially_reliable | frames 75–76 | unreliable | 72.8% | 50.88% | 51.8% / 18 frames |
| `pitch_005` | partially_reliable | frame 54 | unreliable | 88.1% | 71.29% | 71.3% / 13 frames |

The tracking audit found no raw-continuity identity-switch warning. A warning
cannot confirm identity, and its absence cannot prove correct pitcher
selection. The provisional pose policy conservatively marks all five clip
signals unreliable because of long throwing-wrist missing spans. This does
not change the Phase 1 clip acceptance outcome. All five ground-truth files
remain `unreviewed`; actual tracking and keypoint accuracy are unmeasured.
See [Phase 2 reliability](phase2_reliability.md) and
[manual ground truth](phase2_ground_truth.md).
The full suite, including the real five-pitch E2E test, reports **84 passed,
0 failed, 0 skipped** on this Phase 2 branch.

## Formal inputs and preservation

The formal `input/yoshinobu_yamamoto/pitch_001` through `pitch_005` MP4/JSON
pairs are current. A five-pair snapshot used by the E2E runner is at
`input/yoshinobu_yamamoto/phase1_final/`. Both copies were verified to have
matching video and metadata hashes. Metadata `pitch_id` and `video.file`
match each formal filename.

| Formal pitch | Source | Video SHA-256 |
|---|---|---|
| `pitch_001` | Retained | `7c9fe20e39c1b5358aa8e13b739222aebb6bf3ebfadf3569ccb3042c64f10190` |
| `pitch_002` | Retained | `b38258e682370349d085d0b43683f183afc632f682dc85b758604c9d1489f01a` |
| `pitch_003` | `candidate_007` | `5c08dba98504d998536dfd0f0fab598760400612c9049445a68120e68fdf024c` |
| `pitch_004` | `candidate_008` | `e5a57bfc2e0746bb19af2a073d94abb7265d8dfb9ad37de06cee1de29f63d11a` |
| `pitch_005` | `candidate_009` | `e289cb1159e5863583f85915214123d6afe03baa6f32ac6040040878093c873b` |

Before replacement, the previous `pitch_003`–`pitch_005` MP4 and JSON files
were copied to
`input/yoshinobu_yamamoto/archive/superseded_20260924_01/`. All six archived
files were checked against their original SHA-256 hashes; see
`archive_manifest.json` there. The old inputs remain recoverable.

## Final Phase 1 validation

The fresh five-pair E2E run wrote
`analysis_results/phase1_final_yamamoto_20260925_01/`, with
`validation_summary.json`, `artifact_audit.json`, `final_acceptance.json`,
`visual_inspection.json`, `test_suite.log`, five overlay contact sheets, and
one analysis directory per formal pitch under `yoshinobu_yamamoto/`. Every
input-quality result is `accepted`; every MP4 technical result is `validated`;
every keypoint-quality result is `success`.
All five output directories contain raw and processed keypoints, quality files,
metrics, and decodable overlays with one frame per input frame. The analysis
manifests remain `needs_event_review` because event labels are not inferred
automatically.

| Pitch | Total | Valid pose | Rejected | Interpolated | Mean visibility | Longest pose gap | Throwing elbow raw coverage | Lead knee raw coverage | Status |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `pitch_001` | 87 | 87 (100%) | 0 | 16 | 0.814 | 0 frames | 51.72% | 93.10% | success |
| `pitch_002` | 175 | 175 (100%) | 0 | 25 | 0.816 | 0 frames | 65.14% | 98.86% | success |
| `pitch_003` | 115 | 115 (100%) | 0 | 32 | 0.823 | 0 frames | 53.04% | 90.43% | success |
| `pitch_004` | 114 | 112 (98.25%) | 2 | 22 | 0.812 | 2 frames | 50.88% | 90.35% | success |
| `pitch_005` | 101 | 100 (99.01%) | 1 | 19 | 0.827 | 1 frame | 71.29% | 86.14% | success |

All five exceed the unchanged 50% throwing-elbow raw-coverage requirement.
The other core raw feature coverages are at least 80%, and valid pose
coverage is at least 90%. None has a degradation or failure reason.

## Overlay inspection

The five final overlays were reviewed visually using contact sheets that span
each clip. The freshly rendered overlay MP4s are byte-identical to the
corresponding overlays from the earlier all-frame review, and the contact
sheets are retained in the new output directory. All five show
a continuous, plausible rear-centerfield view, preparation through leg lift,
delivery, and follow-through. The selected skeleton remains on pitcher #18;
no whole-subject identity switch or camera cut was observed. No replay or
slow motion was visually observed, although native playback speed cannot be
independently proved from these files.

- `pitch_001`: hands are set at the beginning and the full leg lift is
  visible. The back foot is already beginning to move in the first frame.
  The throwing-elbow margin above 50% is 1.72 percentage points.
- `pitch_002`: a long continuous set precedes leg lift; pose remains on
  the pitcher through recovery.
- `pitch_003`: preparation and follow-through are visible; the pitcher
  remains selected throughout.
- `pitch_004`: frames 75–76 lose the pose briefly during late delivery,
  then reacquire the same pitcher. The elbow margin is 0.88 percentage points.
- `pitch_005`: frame 54 loses the pose briefly, then reacquires the same
  pitcher. Some arm landmarks overlap the batter in image projection, so
  exact joint placement remains a review caveat.

This is an agent visual inspection, not player identity ground truth. The
separate human validation templates, event annotations, and registry
approval remain pending. They do not alter the completed clip-level
Phase 1 acceptance result.

## Tests and repository scope

The full unittest suite ran with
`PITCH_ANALYSIS_REAL_BASELINE_DIR=input/yoshinobu_yamamoto/phase1_final`:
**62 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped**. This includes the opt-in real five-pitch E2E
test. `input/` and `analysis_results/` are intentionally Git-ignored;
Git records this status update, while the videos, archive, and run outputs
remain local.

## Next step recommendation

Keep the five formal clips and the superseded archive unchanged. Have a human
reviewer annotate the five separate Phase 2 ground-truth templates against
each source video and overlay. Then run the comparison workflow and inspect
false negative switch warnings, observed but unreliable joints, and event
visibility. Calibrate reliability labels only after that evidence exists;
do not treat the current heuristic labels as ground-truth accuracy. Do not
begin Phase 3 or add more pitchers yet.
